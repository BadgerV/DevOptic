# DevOptic
### Enterprise DevOps Monitoring & Management Platform

**Centralized visibility and control for microservices infrastructure at scale.**

---

## üéØ **Problem Statement**

Managing 70+ microservices across multiple staging servers creates operational complexity. Development and DevOps teams waste valuable time jumping between GitLab CI/CD, Docker dashboards, service logs, and monitoring tools to get a complete picture of system health.

**DevOptic eliminates this cognitive overhead** by providing unified visibility, automated health checks, and streamlined operations management in a single, intuitive interface.

---

## ‚ö° **Key Features**

### **üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Super Admin** creates custom permissions and roles
- **Granular Permission System** - assign specific permissions to roles
- **User Management** - secure role assignment and access control
- **Audit Trail** - track all administrative actions

### **üîó GitLab Integration**
- **Service Registration** - register repositories with name and ID mapping
- **Service Classification** - distinguish between microservices and macroservices
- **Dependency Management** - handle services that depend on other builds
- **Pipeline Visibility** - monitor CI/CD status across all registered services

### **üìä Health Monitoring**
- **Automated Endpoint Monitoring** - periodic health checks for all registered services
- **Intelligent Alerting** - email notifications when services go down
- **Real-time Status Dashboard** - instant visibility into service health
- **Scalable Architecture** - designed to handle enterprise-level microservices
